//It's Valentine's Day in Russia today. as we all know number of girls in Russia is more than number of boys ğŸ˜œ
// hence boys have an extra advantage while choosing girl for the valentine evening. Each boy has certain number of
// chocolates and each girl has certain number of candies. Now you being the anchor of evening wants to pair all the
// boys with girls such that the sum of absolute difference between boy's chocolate and girl's candy in a pair is minimized.
// Ofcourse some of the girls will remain unpaired but that's okay as we are in Russia ğŸ˜œ
//
//  Input Format
//     The first line consists of two integers N and M. then follow N integers in second line. Then follow M integers in third line. M >= N
//
//  Constraints
//     1 <= N <= 5000
//     1 <= M <= 5000
//     M >= N
//     1 <= chocolates <= 1000000
//     1 <= candies <= 1000000
//
//  Output Format
//     The only line which consists of required sum of absolute differences.
//
//  Sample Input
//     2 5
//     4 5
//     1 2 3 4 5
//   Sample Output
//     0
//
//    Explanation
//      we can pair boy numbered 1 with girl numbered 4 and boy numbered 2 with girl numbered 5


//cant apply greedy because
//eg.  7  8
//     1  10  18
//so we cnt sort and apply greedy

//but we need to sort because
//2 11 3
//5 7  3 2

//select or reject for a boy choice
