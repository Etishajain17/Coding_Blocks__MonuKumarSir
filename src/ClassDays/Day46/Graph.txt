- finite set of edge and vertex
- data - node/vertex , connection - edge
- Undirected and Directed Graph
   ||               ||
   Weighted , Unweighted
- graph neighbour relation
- how to store a graph
    adjacency matrix -- space wastage no edge then also allocating so don't use
                     -- O(1) to check any direct edge present or not
    adjacency list  -- space not wastage
                    -- O(n) to check any direct edge present or not
    HashMap       --


- all vertex should be connected to every other vertex
    n*(n-1)/2
- BFS / DFS
- BFT / DFT

BFS
- 1.remove
- 2.Ignore
- 3.visited (becoz we can go back)
- 4.ques acc. self work
- 5.neighbour add

cycle detection through DFS or BFS.

disconnected graph having more than one component i.e. through one point we can't traverse complete graph through BFS-- so BFT
number of disconnected components through BFT eg. Number of islands

All tree are graph but all graph are not tree
All graph are tree when cycle is not there and one component is present only.

Acyclic graph --> Bipartite
Cyclic graph --> even cycle --> bipartite
             --> odd cycle --> not bipartite

stream point at diff distance if odd cycle
