- Problem Overlapping eq. fibonacci but not merge sort
- Optimal Substructure eq.

Approaches
- Top Down (Memoization)
- Bottom up (Iterative/tabulation)

One time calculated then added so every element just frame created one time and so complexity brcomes linear from exponential
varying things = size of array to take to save the data
